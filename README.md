# WDVisualizer

WDVisualizer is a Python based Wardriving Visualizer Program that allows you to input a .pcap file and get some interesting information.

## Getting Started

Simply install the prerequisites for the program. In order to run the program, put the .pcap you wish to analyze in a folder with the PcapParser.py and run it. Type it in, do not press enter or space. Once you do that, you should have a file called output.txt and you can then run SuperParserV2.py for your output.
